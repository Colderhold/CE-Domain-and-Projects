**Computer Engineering Projects - Semester-wise**

This repository contains a collection of codes and projects that I have worked on during my four years of computer engineering studies. 

The projects are organized semester-wise, showcasing the progression of my skills and knowledge in different areas of computer engineering. 

Each semester folder includes multiple projects, assignments, and code snippets related to the respective courses and topics covered.

**Usage**

Feel free to explore the individual semester folders to access the projects, codes, and assignments from each semester. 

Each project or code snippet is provided with its own documentation and instructions. 

You can review, run, and modify the code to further enhance your understanding or use it as a reference for your own projects.
